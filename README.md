# Resentence

Easy-to-use React component for morphing one string into another. The demo
explains it much better than words can, so [go check out the
demo](https://dphilipson.github.io/resentence).

## Installation

With Yarn:

```
yarn add resentence
```

Or with NPM:

```
npm install resentence
```

## Usage

Wrap text you want to animate in a `<Resentence>` component and specify an
`align` prop, optionally passing `className` or `speed` props as well.

```tsx
import Resentence from "resentence";

// ...

render() {
    return <Resentence className="my-component" align="left" speed={1.5}>
        {this.props.text}
    </Resentence>;
}
```

The props are as follows:

| Prop name   | Required? | Type                            | Description                                                             |
| ----------- | --------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `align`     | Yes       | `"left" \| "center" \| "right"` | How the text is aligned in the document layout. For details, see below. |
| `className` | No        | `string`                        | CSS classes that are passed to the Resentence element.                  |
| `speed`     | No        | `number`                        | Factor by which the animation speed is multiplied (default: 1).         |

### About the `align` prop

Resentence needs a bit of help to compute character positions if the Resentence
element changes size, which is a pretty common occurrence when the text changes
or the window resizes. To correctly animate the transition, Resentence needs to
know which part of the text is the "fixed point" and should remain in the same
location relative to the container as the container changes size.

Thus, Resentence requires the consumer to tell it how its text is aligned. This
is often the same as the container's `text-align` CSS property, and in fact
setting the `align` prop will add the appropriate `text-align` to the element,
but there are situations where an elements effective alignment is not the same
as its `text-align`. For example, right-aligned text can be produced by placing
text at the end of a flexbox row if it is given flex values to take no more
space than needed, forcing the text to be flush against the right side
regardless of its `text-align` property. Rather than attempt to compute
effective alignments for all possible layouts, Resentence instead asks the
consumer to let it know how it will be used in the larger layout of the page.
